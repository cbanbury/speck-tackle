This is fork of SpeckTackle by `sbeisken`. My aim is to port to a Meteor package and add support for
other spectroscopy techniques, such as Raman.

# SpeckTackle
***st.js*** is a JavaScript library to create custom-tailored charts for spectroscopy in life sciences.
Implemented charts exist for mass spectrometry, one- and two-dimensional NMR, UV/VIS, IR, and general continuous data use cases such as chromatograms.
