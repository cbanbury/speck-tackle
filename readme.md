# SpeckTackle
***st.js*** is a JavaScript library to create custom-tailored charts for spectroscopy data. 
Implemented charts exist for mass spectrometry, one- and two-dimensional NMR, and time series data such as chromatograms.

## JSFiddle
Currently not compatible with all browsers because of nosniff header support prohibiting 'hotlinking' of JavaScript files.
See this [GitHub blog entry](https://github.com/blog/1482-) for more information.
